# Flask-Social-Media-App
My first attempt at making a Social Media App
The app is made with Python Flask framework, Jinja2, and SQLAlchemy. 
There is user sign-up and log in functionality. Users can also make posts with text and images.

The app barely has any CSS beacuse I wanted to focus on functionality. There are also a few visual bugs, like posts not diplsaying the correct name of the user who made the post, but rather showing the user that is currently logged in.
